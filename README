If libtcc cannot be found, manually set the LIBTCC environment variable.

Windows users that trust a binary TinyCC version compiled from the
public 'mob' development branch[1][2] may use

    zef install TinyCC::Resources::Win64

to install a minimal TinyCC distro into their Rakudo prefix.

Using that version should be as simple as

    perl6 -MTinyCC::Bundled example.p6

Documentation has yet to be written. For now, just take a look at some
example code[3][4].
